<p style="color:white; background-color:MediumSeaGreen"> It was on 18th July 2020, as i wrote this the birds are chirping, the sun is shining but balanced by wind blowing softly at me and my family
 In front of me, is a calming sight. Gosh, the sound of the water streams is so beautiful and calming. Can life really get any better than this? My heart is full.
<br>
We’re at a glamping resort now that the MCO has allowed people to travel but only within the country. <br>My Instagram feed is filled with happy photos of my friends and their families, that put a smile on my face. <br>It’s so nice to see everyone smile again after 3 months of being told to stay home because of the pandemic.<br>It’s almost as if all this happened to teach us to appreciate the moments that matter in life – family. 
Taught us to reflect, refresh and just recharge.<br>And now, everyone’s looking to go out and we’re “forced” to discover our country and the beauty it has to offer. And that’s such a good thing! I can’t remember the last time I dipped my feet in a river, or kicked a football! Felt really good
I was glamping at the Tiarasa.<br>I loved it so much that I brought my family too. I’m grateful that I am able to spend time with them like this – and for them to spend time with the cucu’s, away from the busy bustling city. You should see my mom, taking pictures of everything (like mother, like daughter). And my dad, fussing if they’ve sanitised the place and whether people here have coronavirus. Balanced parenthood, for sure.
Ah…. I’m soaking in so much happiness and gratitude in this very second. Grateful that God has given this life to us, for all its good and bad that are basically just colouring the canvas of life. I wouldn’t change it one bit.</p>
